## 📦 Local Development

If you wish to clone and run this project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianodad/IanAderaPortfolio.git
cd IanAderaPortfolio
```

### 2. Open the file

Since this project is a single-page application contained entirely within a single `index.html` file using React and Babel Standalone for in-browser compilation, you only need to open the file directly in your web browser.

> **Note:** For live development with hot-reloads, it is recommended to use a simple local server extension (like **Live Server** in VS Code).
